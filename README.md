Destiny Loadout Game
A web application designed to create randomized weapon loadouts for private matches in Destiny 2. This tool connects to your Bungie.net account, reads the weapons available in your vault, generates a valid loadout according to specific rules, and delivers the loadout to your character, adding a fun challenge to custom games. Players using the application will be able to host lobbies that display each player's loadout to the whole group.

Key Features
Bungie.net Authentication: Securely log in with your Bungie.net account to grant the application access to your character inventories and vault.

Random Loadout Generation: With a single click, generate a random weapon loadout consisting of:

1 Primary Ammo Weapon
1 Special Ammo Weapon
1 Heavy Ammo Weapon
